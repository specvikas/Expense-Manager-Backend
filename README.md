Expense Manager Backend

To get started, you can clone the code and open in any of the IDE as a maven project. (Intellij is recommended)

Prerequisites :

- You must have mysql installed in the system you are cloning this. I was using version 5.7.13 so I have used MySQL5Dialect so install mysql version of 5.x.y or you can change
  the dialect in the configuration file application.yml as per the installed version of mysql.
  
Once all is done, you can run the project as Java Application, Tomcat Server will serve this Spring Boot application on 9001. Again you can change the port in application.yml
